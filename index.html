      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is Aldwin Lubrica and I am excited to learn about web development and coding in this bootcamp!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>San Diego, CA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>In my free time, I like to entertain myself with horror movies, true crime documentaries, anime and video games!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>This may sound funny, but I have always wanted to work in an office in my own cubicle preferably getting paid to code.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently reside in a quiet suburb in San Diego with access to many diverse cultures and food.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web development allows you to expand your imagnination while bringing it to life. I feel that there is never a threshold in this industry which is one of the many reasons as to why web development intrigues me so much -- you never really stop learning.</p>
